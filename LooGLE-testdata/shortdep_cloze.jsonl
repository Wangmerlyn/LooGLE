DANNER (CONT'D)  \nJust a puddle of water in the \nentryway floor. Okay. Anyway, I\u2019m \nDetective Danner, and this is... \n \nShe gets distracted by everything in the room: The walls are \ncovered with posters, records, and other memorabilia. On the \nconcrete floor are a single SNOW SKI, a purple BOA, a \u201cXavier \nWorld Tour 2015\u201d TRACK SUIT jacket and pants, a broken \nacoustic GUITAR, an ARROW lodged into a poster of Xavier, \nseveral red plastic cups and spilled beer.  \n \nDET. CULP  \nCulp. I\u2019m Detective Culp. Everyone -- \nDET. DANNER  \nAre these pigs in blankets? I\u2019m \nstarving.  \n \nShe dips a pig-in-blanket in mustard on a nearby tray. \nDET. CULP  \nThat could be evidence.  \nDET. DANNER  \nIt\u2019s not evidence, it\u2019s a snack.  \n \nA pot-bellied PIG runs by. She puts it back on the tray  and \nturns to the group. \n \nDET. DANNER (CONT'D)  \nAlright everyone, let\u2019s get to it.  \nDET. CULP  \nShouldn\u2019t we go check out the scene \nof the crime first?  \n \nDET. DANNER  \nYeah, I suppose.  \n(sighs, then to group) \nWe\u2019ll be right back.  \nThey walk upstairs. When she\u2019s out of earshot: \nBRETT \nThis sucks. How long do we have to \nstay in here? This is America.  \nFreedom or whatever.  \nZOE \nBrett. A person died tonight.  The Afterparty First Ep Proposal  6/9/20 10. The Afterparty First Ep Proposal 6/9/20  10.  \n \nYASPER \nYeah and it was a rich and famous \nperson, so it\u2019s extra sad. \n \nBrett walks out onto the lower balcony, annoyed. INDIGO, a \nnihilist dressed in all black, pipes up. \n \nINDIGO \nAll life is precious. And also \nmeaningless.  \n \nCHELSEA \nYou\u2019re all such frauds. None of us \nhere really knew Xavier. Or even \nliked him. \n \nNED \nI\u2019ve seen all of his movies.  \nYASPER \nWe had a bond...  \nJENNIFER 1  \nWe all know what happened.  \nShe stares daggers at Aniq, who snaps out of his funk.  \nANIQ \nNo we don\u2019t! What are you implying?  \n \nEXT. XAVIER\u2019S MANSION, LOWER BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER  \n \nBrett watches the far rocks below, as police bag the body and \ntransport it away. Chelsea approaches. He\u2019s instantly jumpy.  \n \nBRETT \nHow many times tonight have I said \nI don\u2019t want to talk to you? \n \nCHELSEA \nThree. \nBRETT \nThen why are you talking to me?  \nCHELSEA \nBecause I know what you\u2019re hiding \nin that room, and -- \n \nBrett stiffens. He turns to her, serious:  The Afterparty First Ep Proposal  6/9/20 10. The Afterparty First Ep Proposal 6/9/20  11.  \n \nBRETT \nAnd I know what you said in the \nschool hallway, so-- \n \nCHELSEA \nSo nobody needs to say anything.  \nBRETT \nAbout anything . \n \nEXT./INT.

DANN ER \nShh, can\u2019t hear.  \n \nDanner doesn\u2019t take her eyes off the two below. She watches \nBrett SLAM his hands on the railing and walk away. \n \nDanner walks into the bedroom. Culp follows her.  \nDET. CULP  \nThere\u2019s one drop of blood on the \nbalcony floor, probably from Xavier \nbeing punched in the nose, but -- \n \nDanner walks past the cops photographing/dusting the bedroom, \npicks something out of her teeth in the closet mirror door, \nwalks out the bedroom door cordoned off with tape. \n \nDET. CULP (C ONT'D) \nDon\u2019t you care about --? \nDET. DANNER  \nWe\u2019re not going to learn anything \nup here. \n \nShe walks downstairs to:  \n \nINT.

DANNER  \nAnd we\u2019re back! Is everyone that\u2019s \nstill here accounted for, and in \nthis room? Anyone who isn\u2019t here, \nraise your hand. That is, raise \nyour hand if you know who isn\u2019t \nhere on behalf of the hand of the \nperson who isn\u2019t here... No one? \n \nEveryone stares at her. Aniq is like \u201cthis is who they  sent\u201d? \nDET. DANNER (CONT'D)  \nOkay. There are too many of you to \ntake to the station so I\u2019ll \ninterview everyone here. No one may \nleave until questioning is over. \nCould take a few hours.  \nJennifer 1 steps forward.  \nJENNIFER 1  \nHours?! I volunteer to go first. We \nall know Aniq killed him. \n \nANIQ \nOh my GOD. No. I did not!  \nDET. DANNER  \n(to Jennifer 1)  \nDid you witness the murder \nfirsthand?  \n \nJENNIFER 1  \nNo, but I found the body first -- \nDET. DANNER  \nThen you don\u2019t know what really \nhappened, do you? You only know \nyour own subjective experience. And \neveryone is the star of their own \nmovie. \n \nShe stares at them, one by one. Jennifer 1, Brett, Zoe, Aniq. \nEach person looks nervous, shifty, furtive.  \n \nDET. DANNER (CONT'D)  \nThat\u2019s why I have a process: if you \nunderstand enough personal \nnarratives, overlay enough mind - \nmovies, you can see what they have \nin common and what they don\u2019t... \nand that\u2019s when you get a sense of \nthat elusive element: the truth.

XAVIER\u2019S MANSION - EARLIER (FLASHBACK)  \n \nIndigo\u2019s FLASHBACK is told as a BLACK & WHITE ART HOUSE FILM, \nlike the Lighthouse. Nihilistic, cold,  cerebral.  \n \nJennifer 1 is on the LOWER BALCONY  with JENNIFER 2, also \npreppy and pregnant. Inside, in the LIVING ROOM , Ned \ncarefully places a row of beers in red plastic cups balancing \non a SNOW SKI laid on Aniq\u2019s passed -out, Sharpied  body. \nIndigo is between them.  \nJENNIFER 1  \nCome out and enjoy the view with me \nand stop pranking Aniq.  \n \nNED \nThis is more than a prank.

It falls on Jenn 1\u2019s  hair. \n \nJENNIFER 1  \nAAAAAH! \nNed LAUGHS, cackling uncontrollably. Indigo remains calm.  \nINDIGO \nUrine is a natural astringent for \nthe scalp. I use a body waste-based \ntincture on my head daily. \n \nJennifer 1 ignores her and rushes inside. Ned helps her step \naround Aniq\u2019s body. They try to go in the foyer bathroom,  but \nthe door is locked. \n \nVOICE (O.S.)  \nOccupied!  \n \nSuddenly: NOISE and LIGHTS behind her. Indigo faces away from \nthe action, still.

DANNER (V.O.)  \nWhat was on the TV?  \nINDIGO (V.O.)  \nI try to avoid looking at screens.  \n \nWhatever plays, wakes up Aniq. He gets \u201cskiied\u201d and all the \nbeers spill on him. Ned is loving the result of his prank. \n \nNED \nHa ha! Where is Brett? He would \nLOVE this! \n \nAniq shouts out cryptic outbursts.  \nANIQ \nHe did it again. The door is \nclosed!

Everyone stands perfectly still.  \n \nINDIGO (V.O.)  \nA moment later, we heard a sound \nfrom above not unlike the squeal of \na dolphin giving birth.  \n \nSQUEEEEEEAL!  \nJennifer 1 rushes outside...  \nJENNIFER 1  \nWhat made that horrible noise?  \nJennifer 1 SCREAMS! Ned SCREAMS louder than Jennifer 1.  \n \nIndigo goes to see what they are screaming about.

Chelsea looks at the floor.  \nDET. DANNER (C ONT'D) \nBut on a heightened night like \ntonight, if something threatens \nyour worldview, someone pushes you \nto the breaking point, your fight- \nor-flight kicks in and you\u2019re not \nthinking rationally anymore. Any \none of us, any one of us, can SNAP. \n \nEveryone flinches at her loud \u201cSNAP.\u201d  \nDET.

But \nsolving a case isn\u2019t about facts \nand figures. It\u2019s about following \nyour intuition.  \n \nANIQ \n...But it also kind of is about \nfacts and figures.  \n \nDANNER \nLike I said, I\u2019ve got a process. \nAnd I\u2019ve been criticized for it. \nBut it works. For instance, I can \ntell by your clothes you were a \nscholarship kid, a hard worker with \na lot to lose. \n \nANIQ \nMy button down says all that?  \nDANNER \nAnd a scholarship kid must be \npretty smart. What\u2019s 37 times 42? \n \nANIQ \n...Um, 1,554? \nDANNER \n(pulling out phone)  \nHold on, just checking a text here - \n- this is completely unrelated... \n(typing something)  \nYep, 1,554.

But it was more than \nthat. Or at least could\u2019ve been.  \nBut things happened, we graduated, \nshe got married and we didn\u2019t see \neach other for twenty years. I \nthought that door was closed. \n \nAniq pulls into a spot in the High School parking  lot. \nANIQ (V.O.)  \nThen I heard she got divorced, and \nlast week I got an email-- \n \nAniq has Zoe\u2019s email on his phone screen.

More subtle. You get my texts \nabout her being single?  \n \nANIQ \nI did. Thank you for those. Also \nthe coupon for an A/V installation?  \n \nYASPER \nAlways hustlin\u2019 -- And boom! \n(showing Aniq his phone) \nZoe changed her status from \n\u201cMarried\u201d to \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated.\u201d \nIt\u2019s like she\u2019s begging you to make \na move tonight.  \n \nANIQ \nOr she wants the world to know that \nher life is, in fact, complicated. \nWhich would make sense. She just \ngot out of a relationship. I\u2019m \ngonna keep it casual. \n \nYASPER \nYou can\u2019t think like that! This is \nyour second chance to make a first \nimpression.
